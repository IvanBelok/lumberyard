LUMBERYARD TERMS
0. These Lumberyard Terms incorporate by reference the AWS Customer Agreement at https://aws.amazon.com/agreement (the "Agreement").  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are defined in the Agreement.

1. Lumberyard Materials. Amazon Lumberyard consists of an engine, integrated development environment, related assets, and tools we make available in this repository or otherwise designate as Lumberyard materials (collectively, "Lumberyard Materials"). The Lumberyard Materials include the "Lumberyard Redistributables", listed at https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-lumberyard-user-guide/blob/master/doc_source/lumberyard-redistributables.md. Lumberyard Materials are AWS Content. The term "Lumberyard Materials" does not include Content distributed with the Lumberyard Materials under separate license terms (such as code licensed under an open source license).

2. License. In addition to the rights granted to AWS Content under the Intellectual Property License at https://aws.amazon.com/legal/aws-ip-license-terms/, AWS also grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except to End Users as provided below), non-transferrable license to do the following during the Term:

(a) Development: You may use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of the Lumberyard Materials to develop and support video games, software, audio-visual works, and other content (each work created through use of the Lumberyard Materials is a "Lumberyard Project"). Lumberyard Projects, excluding any AWS Content and Third Party Content included therein, are Your Content.

(b) Distribution to End Users: You may use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute (including via third party distributors) to End Users the Lumberyard Redistributables (including any permitted modifications and derivatives) as part of a Lumberyard Project. However, you may do so only if (i) the Lumberyard Project provides material content or functionality beyond that provided by the Lumberyard Redistributables themselves, (ii) the Lumberyard Redistributables are integrated into the Lumberyard Project so they are not separately usable by End Users, (iii) you do not distribute in source code form Lumberyard Redistributables that we make available in file formats that are commonly compiled (e.g., C, C++) or for which we make a compiler available, and (iv) you ensure End Users are subject to terms no less protective of the Lumberyard Materials than these Terms, including this Section and Sections 4 and 5 below. You may sublicense these rights, subject to the restrictions in these terms, to your End Users to allow them to use, modify, create new content for, and redistribute your Lumberyard Project (e.g., create new items or levels for a game).

(c) Collaboration with other AWS customers. You may reproduce and distribute (but not sublicense) the Lumberyard Materials (including any permitted modifications and derivatives): (i) to other AWS customers that are contractors of yours solely for the purpose of allowing those AWS customers to perform work on your behalf, (ii) to other AWS customers in connection with work you perform for them as a contractor, and (iii) to up to 5 other AWS customers who you authorize to distribute a Lumberyard Project in connection with your sale or licensing of that Lumberyard Project (e.g., publishers of a game you develop). Those other AWS customers' rights to the Lumberyard Materials are governed by their agreement(s) with us.

(d) Lumberyard Git Repository. We may make available certain Lumberyard Materials on the "Lumberyard Git Repository." You may reproduce and distribute to other AWS customers, via the Lumberyard Git Repository, your modified version(s) of those Lumberyard Materials (your "LM Fork(s)"), subject to any policies we may establish for the Lumberyard Git Repository. Your LM Fork must comply with the Agreement, the Intellectual Property License and these Terms; for example, it may not enable Lumberyard Projects to use, or read or write data to or from, Alternate Web Services. You must include a notice stating that the LM Fork is subject to these Terms (such as a copy of the License.txt file from the root directory of the Lumberyard Materials). If you obtain an LM Fork from the Lumberyard Git Repository, you are responsible for ensuring that any Lumberyard Project you create with it complies with these Terms. If your LM Fork violates the Agreement or the Intellectual Property License, then it infringes our copyright in the Lumberyard Materials and we may remove it from the Lumberyard Git Repository and take other actions, including terminating your license to the Lumberyard Materials. "Alternate Web Service" means any non-AWS web service that is similar to or can act as a replacement for the services listed at https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-lumberyard-user-guide/blob/master/doc_source/lumberyard-alternate-web-services.md.

3. No License Fee. There is no fee for the licenses granted in Section 2. AWS Services, AWS Content and Third Party Content made available in connection with the Lumberyard Materials may be subject to separate charges and governed by additional terms.

4. Operating Restrictions. Without our prior written consent, (a) the Lumberyard Materials (including any permitted modifications and derivatives) may only be run on computer equipment owned and operated by you or your End Users, or on AWS Services, and may not be run on any Alternate Web Service and (b) your Lumberyard Project may not read data from or write data to any Alternate Web Service.

5. Other Restrictions. Without limiting the restrictions set out in the Agreement and Intellectual Property License respectively, you may not (a) distribute the Lumberyard Materials in source code form, except as expressly permitted by Section 42.2(b) and (c), (b) use or exploit the Lumberyard Materials or any portion thereof to develop, maintain, participate in the development of, or support any competing engine, development tool, or software framework, (c) use the Lumberyard Materials or any portion thereof as part of a logo or trademark, (d) remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) contained in the Lumberyard Materials, (e) take any action that would require AWS, Inc. or you to license, distribute, or otherwise make available to anyone the Lumberyard Materials under different terms (e.g., combining Lumberyard Materials with software subject to "copyleft" open source licenses), or (f) use or exploit the Lumberyard Materials or any portion thereof in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms.

6. Registration; Release. Before distributing your Lumberyard Project to End Users, you must register here. You must obtain our prior written consent if the initial public or commercial release of your Lumberyard Project is based on a version of the Lumberyard Materials more than 5 years old.

7. Credit. You must credit us in Lumberyard Projects in accordance with these guidelines. The AWS Trademark Guidelines apply to the use of AWS Marks included in the Lumberyard Materials. We may use excerpts of publicly released promotional material from your Lumberyard Projects and related trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos in connection with our marketing, advertisement, and promotion of Lumberyard.

8. Forums; Submissions. In addition to your rights to distribute LM Forks on the Lumberyard Git Repository set out above, when discussing Lumberyard Materials in our forums or elsewhere, you may include up to 50 lines of source code from the Lumberyard Materials for the sole purpose of discussing that code. You must identify AWS as the source of the code. "Lumberyard Submissions" are content relating to Lumberyard Materials (including LM Forks) that you post or otherwise submit to developer discussion sites, sample code repositories, or other AWS or public forums. You grant (i) us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and fully paid up license under all intellectual property rights to your Lumberyard Submissions, and (ii) other AWS customers the same rights to your Lumberyard Submissions as these Lumberyard Terms provide to the Lumberyard Materials. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant the license above, and that your Lumberyard Submissions do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party or violate this Agreement.

9. Data Collection. The Lumberyard Materials may provide us with information about the use of the Lumberyard Materials, including information about system and server resources, features used in the integrated development environment, frequency and duration of use, geographic and network locations, and error and information messages.

10. Acceptable Use; Safety-Critical Systems. Your use of the Lumberyard Materials must comply with the AWS Acceptable Use Policy posted at https://aws.amazon.com/aup. The Lumberyard Materials are not intended for use with life-critical or safety-critical systems, such as use in operation of medical equipment, automated transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, aircraft or air traffic control, nuclear facilities, manned spacecraft, or military use in connection with live combat. However, this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.

11. Termination. Your rights in the Lumberyard Materials automatically terminate if the Agreement terminates or you breach the Agreement or these Terms. However, if we terminate the Agreement for convenience, your rights in Lumberyard Materials then in your possession survive termination with respect to any previously registered Lumberyard Project. Otherwise, upon termination, you must cease all use, distribution, and other exploitation of the Lumberyard Materials (and any modifications and derivatives).
